What is Taxi out time:
The Taxi-out time is defined as the time spent by a flight between its actual off-block time (AOBT) and actual take-off time (ATOT)

Problem Definition: 
According to the Airline Service quality performance (ASQP) data in 2011, about 17% of the total flight time was spent for taxiing on the ground. This motivates research of efficient surface operations that can reduce the taxi delay, which is primarily due to the congestion. It is important to predict the taxi-out times of departures accurately to increase takeoff time predictability and improve efficiency of airport operations. Accurate taxi time prediction can help airport traffic controllers estimate when departures arrive at the assigned runways for takeoffs and reduce the uncertainty in actual wheels-off times of departures. 

Main goal of this project: 
This project presents an effort to improve the accuracy of estimating the taxi-out time .
